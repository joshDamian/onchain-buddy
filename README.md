## About
Onchain Buddy is a WhatsApp-based chatbot that provides real-time blockchain data and notifications for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. Users can query wallet balances (both native tokens and ERC-20), track transaction details by hash, subscribe to wallet activity notifications, and retrieve essential network statistics across EVM-based chains like Ethereum and Arbitrum. The bot also offers customizable visual analytics, generating charts and dashboards based on on-chain activity, which are delivered as shareable images. Powered by LLM integration, it enables natural language interaction for seamless user experience.
